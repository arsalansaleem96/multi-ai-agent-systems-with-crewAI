      "Attracting attendees to your conference can be one of the most challenging aspects of event planning. You want your event to be memorable and impactful, just like the best conferences you’ve attended. Effective conference marketing is the key to achieving this. By using the right strategies, you can boost registrations and ensure your event stands out. Here are 12 effective conference marketing ideas that will drive registrations and make your event a success.\n",
      "What Is Conference Marketing?\n",
      "Before we dive into tips and ideas, let’s make sure we’re all on the same page. Conference marketing includes everything you do to encourage people to attend your event. It involves any advertising you purchase to promote the event, but there’s much more to it than just ads.\n",
      "Marketing covers your social media campaigns, the design of your website and event app, and the research you do to identify who is most likely to attend your event and where you can find them to send invitations. All of this falls under conference marketing, making it a broad topic with plenty to unpack.\n",
      "Don’t worry, we’ll cover all the essentials here.\n",
      "Why Is Conference Marketing So Important for Your Event?\n",
      "If you want people to attend your conference, they need to know about it. That’s the primary goal of conference marketing. There are various strategies to help with this, including different promotional techniques.\n",
      "Effective marketing engages your audience directly, showing them what your conference is all about and what they stand to gain from attending.\n",
      "Consider your own perspective. Would a plain ad for a conference catch your eye, or would a dynamic, engaging promotion showcasing event highlights be more enticing?\n",
      "As you read through these marketing ideas and tips, remember that creating excitement and interest is key to effective outreach. Some tips focus on different aspects of marketing, but the goal is to craft a cohesive strategy that draws in your audience.\n",
      "12 Conference Marketing Ideas\n",
      "When you start your marketing campaign, what’s the best approach? How can you ensure you reach your target audience and get them to register?\n",
      "There’s no single perfect answer, but creative solutions are available. The 12 ideas below all work, but they’re just the beginning. Use them directly or as inspiration to customize your own unique marketing ideas.\n",
      "Polls\n",
      "Drive interest and engagement by asking your attendees what they want. Online polls about food options, conference events, and more can help you gauge what’s important to them. Show you’re listening and provide what they need, and you’ll generate buzz for your event.\n",
      "Interesting Venues\n",
      "Choosing the right venue can drive interest by itself. Unique venues offer an experience of their own. Pair that with your interesting conference, and you’ll be the talk of the town before you even start.\n",
      "Finding interesting venues can be challenging depending on your region, type of conference, budget, and more. Always think about how to score the most interesting venue possible before making early commitments.\n",
      "Sponsorships\n",
      "Collaborating with sponsors gives you more resources and can help establish your credibility. Major brand names attached to your marketing will grab attention.\n",
      "Reach out to sponsors relevant to your event to drive even more interest.\n",
      "Giveaways\n",
      "Give people a chance to win things just by registering. Sweepstakes and door prizes motivate people to sign up sooner. As attendance increases, socializing effects kick in—people want what others like.\n",
      "Gamification\n",
      "Take it a step further with gamification. Create contests with prizes, like photo contests, content creation, scavenger hunts, or trivia, leading up to your event.\n",
      "Gamification gets people involved and excited early. Post leaderboards so everyone can see and gain inspiration.\n",
      "Live Streaming and Social Media\n",
      "For direct marketing, video, live streams and social media are tops. Regular posts build hype over time. Announce new speakers, event updates, and more through posts.\n",
      "Live streams can showcase the uniqueness of your event beforehand. Social media also creates two-way communication, giving you a better feel for your audience’s pulse.\n",
      "Scarcity\n",
      "Use scarcity tactics to motivate people to sign up today instead of tomorrow. Offer early bird discounts, limit ticket sales to narrow windows, or have flash sales.\n",
      "Surveys\n",
      "Some of your best marketing comes from your last event. After each event, send out surveys. Gather data on what people liked, disliked, and wished was there. Use this data to build hype for your next event.\n",
      "Diversification\n",
      "Market through as many channels as you can. Use every social media platform. Outreach through email, physical mail, radio spots, influencers, and flyers. Diversify your media—posts, blogs, photos, videos, pay-per-click ads. Use everything.\n",
      "Testimonials\n",
      "Your diverse marketing benefits from your own content. Use photos and videos from previous events and tap into testimonials from past attendees. Show the next crowd what makes your conferences special.\n",
      "Pre-Event Networking\n",
      "Create exclusive networking spaces for attendees. Private Facebook groups or Discord channels help attendees plan meet-ups at your conference and offer valuable networking opportunities.\n",
      "Pop-Up Events\n",
      "Pop-up advertising creates hype and content opportunities. Film your pop-up events, take photos, and gather testimonials to generate digital content for your marketing.\n",
      "Conference Marketing Tips\n",
      "While these ideas can stimulate creativity and help grow your audience, there are some general tips to build a solid foundation.\n",
      "The most interesting marketing concept will fall flat if you don’t cover the basics. These six tips will help you build that foundation:\n",
      "Create Your Content Strategy\n",
      "Start with a plan. Your strategy flows naturally from your conference concept. Identify your audience, consider your budget, goals, strengths, and weaknesses. Map your timeline, figure out who you’re trying to reach, and start developing your marketing content.\n",
      "Build a Strong Website and Event App\n",
      "Your strategy hinges on your website, the hub designed to receive the traffic you generate. If your website or event app is dysfunctional, your efforts are wasted. Make sure they look great and function well. Test and debug them thoroughly.\n",
      "Make It Easy to Register\n",
      "Focus on registration. It’s the end goal of your marketing. If your registration system is broken or complicated, you’re working against yourself. Test it extensively before going live. For effective registration solutions, check out MemberClicks Registration Tech.\n",
      "Choose the Right Social Channels\n",
      "Who are your attendees? Where can you find them? Diversify your marketing but focus resources on the most valuable social channels for your target audience.\n",
      "Offer Incentives\n",
      "Incentives like gamification, sweepstakes, networking, and limited offers give extra reasons to attend. They boost motivation and attendance.\n",
      "Analyze Data for Future Marketing\n",
      "Use digital marketing tools to create metrics. Analyze data to see which methods work best and adjust accordingly. Use old data to start your next campaign.\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "Conference marketing offers many opportunities and methodologies. Start with the fundamentals for a solid strategy:\n",

      "Manchester Central Convention Complex (commonly known as Manchester Central or GMEX (Greater Manchester Exhibition Centre)) is an exhibition and conference centre converted from the former Manchester Central railway station in Manchester, England. The building has a distinctive arched roof with a span of 64 metres (210 ft) – the second-largest railway station roof span in the United Kingdom,[7] and was granted Grade II* listed building status in 1963.\n",
      "After 89 years as a railway terminus, it closed to passengers in May 1969. It was renovated as an exhibition centre formerly known as the G-Mex Centre in 1982 and was Manchester's primary music concert venue until the construction of the Manchester Arena. After renovation the venue reverted to its former name Manchester Central in 2007.\n",
      "From April 2020 until March 2021, the complex became a temporary field hospital for non-critical COVID-19 patients,[8] part of a network of temporary NHS Nightingale Hospitals.[9]\n",
      "History[edit]\n",
      "Manchester Central railway station[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Manchester Central railway station\n",
      "An illustrative image of the old Manchester Central railway station, dated 1905.\n",
      "The complex was originally Manchester Central railway station, one of the city's main railway terminals.[10]\n",
      "Designed by Sir John Fowler, the station was opened in July 1880 by the Cheshire Lines Committee. The station served as the terminus for Midland Railway express trains to London St Pancras. The station's large wrought-iron single-span arched roof, spanning 210 feet (64 m), 550 feet (168 m) long and 90 feet (27 m) high – was a noted piece of railway engineering and is the widest unsupported iron arch in Britain after the Barlow train shed at London St Pancras.[11]\n",
      "At its height, in the 1930s, more than 400 trains passed through the station every day.[12]\n",
      "The station operated for 89 years, before closing in May 1969.[13]\n",
      "GMEX Centre[edit]\n",
      "The interior of the derelict station before its renovation in 1982\n",
      "In 1978, the structure was acquired by Greater Manchester County Council to redevelop as a concert venue. In 1982, construction work was undertaken by Alfred McAlpine.[14] It was the centrepiece of the regeneration plan for the area and wider Castlefield district. The hall covered 10,000 m2 (110,000 sq ft) and could be partitioned into various sized units for different exhibitions.[15] Initial construction work concentrated on repairing the derelict structure and re-pointing brickwork which took 18 months.[14] The Greater Manchester Exhibition Centre or G-Mex Centre was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1986 after four years of renovation.[16]\n",
      "In 2001, the Manchester International Convention Centre (MICC) was added, comprising an 804-seat auditorium and breakout rooms and the Great Northern Hall. In 2005, the company running the complex was bought by Manchester City Council. G-Mex was Manchester's primary concert venue from 1986 to 1995. Its position as a concert venue diminished after the opening of the Manchester (then NYNEX) Arena in 1995.[17]\n",
      "Manchester Central[edit]\n",
      "In January 2007, the venue was renamed Manchester Central, evoking the memory of the former station[18][19] and converted into an exhibition and conference centre. The building was renovated at a cost of £30 million in 2008 by Manchester-based architects, Stephenson Bell. The first phase to create a foyer took from February to November 2008.[20]\n",
      "The second phase, completed towards the end of 2009, included an extended foyer to the Grade II listed Central Hall. The old smoked-glass structure was demolished and replaced by a flat-roofed, clear-glazed structure exposing more of the original architecture.[11] The final phase, completed in September 2010, focused on the rear of the building. New event spaces were built and rooms refurbished to increase the venue's range and size of meeting and banqueting spaces.[21]\n",
      "Events[edit]\n",
      "During its days as the GMEX Centre, the venue was used for hosting rock concerts. Not long after its official opening, Factory Records used the venue for their Festival of the Tenth Summer in July 1986 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of punk in the city, and included appearances by the Smiths and Factory Records stalwarts New Order.[22] James appeared in 1990, U2 in June 1992, Metallica in November 1992 on their The Black Album tour and the Cure in November 1992. G-Mex had a seating capacity of 9,500 for end stage concerts and 12,500 for standing events and stopped hosting concerts in 1997, with the last gig by Oasis in December. G-Mex was also the 2002 Commonwealth Games venue for gymnastics, weightlifting, judo and wrestling.[23]\n",
      "After a nine-year break, it was again used for concerts by Snow Patrol in December 2006 with Morrissey, the Verve, Marilyn Manson, Franz Ferdinand, Manic Street Preachers, Arctic Monkeys,[24] Bloc Party and Hard-Fi holding concerts in 2007. Status Quo have performed there multiple times. The venue hosted concerts by Placebo in December 2009, Arcade Fire, Biffy Clyro, Thirty Seconds to Mars, the Taste of Chaos Tour 2010, deadmau5,[25] Pendulum in December 2010 and the Eighth Plague Tour. In 2011, it hosted the Girls' Day Out Show.[26]\n",
      "In 2009 and 2010, it played host to the Manchester audition stages of the ITV programme The X Factor. In December 2012, it hosted the finals of series 9 of The X Factor.[27]\n",
      "In September 2006, the Labour Party moved from traditional seaside venues to hold its annual party conference at the complex. It has also hosted conferences for the Confederation of British Industry, ECOFIN, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative Party.[28][29]\n",
      "The venue was also the filming location of Ninja Warrior UK between 2015 and 2019.[30]\n",
      "The venue was selected to host the final of the 2021 Wheelchair Rugby League World Cup,[31] which saw England beat France 28–24 to lift their second world cup title equalling the record set by the runners-up.[32]\n",
      "Transport[edit]\n",
      "Located in the heart of the city, Manchester Central is served by two Metrolink tram stops – Deansgate-Castlefield tram stop and St Peter's Square tram stop, both of which are under a five-minute walk from the venue. National Rail local train services serve Deansgate railway station whilst Manchester Piccadilly is a 20 minute walk away.[33]\n",
      "Emergency hospital[edit]\n",
      "Main article: NHS Nightingale Hospital North West\n",
      "On 27 March 2020, the UK government announced that the building would be converted into an emergency hospital, part of a network of NHS Nightingale Hospitals similar to the NHS Nightingale Hospital London that was already under construction, intended to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and with 1,000 beds. It opened on 17 April 2020,[9] and was closed in March 2021.[34]\n",

Keri was involved with our process from day one which made us feel special already, and even attended our Reception to ensure things ran smoothly. The food was absolutely amazing, especially since we asked for a wide array of food, and Keri met every single one of our needs. I don’t think the process for planning a wedding reception could have gone any smoother.“The charm and ambiance of the Riverside Room”Our decision to hold a rehearsal dinner in the Riverside Room, with Tidewater Catering, was truly a great one. The location was convient and our guests repeatedly referred to the charm and ambiance of the space. Your attention to detail and service was outstanding. The food was delicious and well presented. Thank you, Keri, for making the event a memorable one.“Work ethic, passion, and commitment are tops”Keri’s work ethic, passion, and commitment to her clients are admirable to say the least…We can speak first-hand to her impressive drive and willingness to work within her clients’ resources: no job is too big or too small; no obstacles are insurmountable.“We were impressed by the attention to detail”Keri, it was a great event. Jordan and company handled everything very well! The place was just a great space, plenty of room for everyone. The food was a good mix and our vegans/vegetarians were downright excited. You’re right that everybody loves that polenta. The best comment from that side of the group was the excitement expressed by one vegan guest that she could actually eat more than lettuce. We were impressed by the attention to detail, including the periodic clean-up of the pecans near the salad!AwardsBest NH Corporate Event CatererBest of BusinessBest CatererBest of NHTop 5 Most Intriguing Woman in NH BusinessBusiness NH MagazineBest Wedding CatererUnion Leader Reader's ChoiceTop 50 Women Led NH BusinessBusiness NH MagazineBusiness Excellence WinnerNH Business Review\n",
